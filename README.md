# Motor_Controlling
A small project to control the speed of DC motor using Pulse width modulation mode in Timers controlling its duty cycle by potentiometer which used also to act like input sensor to ADC and present its result on LCD. in additional to push button which switch the direction of rotation of DC motor however his speed was. This project was implemented based on ATmega16, Eclipse, and Proteus for simulation. Drivers used to implement this project: Timer, ADC, LCD, and external interrupt
